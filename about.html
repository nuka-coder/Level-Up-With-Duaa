    <button class="accordion-pink">
      <p class="question">What is life coaching?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>A Life Coach is an accountability partner invested in your personal growth and development. We help our clients identify limiting beliefs holding them back from fulfilling their best life. We construct affirmations with our clients to defeat
        negative thoughts and promote positive and sustainable actions. Each life coach has a niche in which they best to service their clients.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-green">
      <p class="question">What is your niche?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>My strength is implementing organizational techniques and habits, creating clarity of thought, and developing a vision. I best service women looking to take their progress up a notch. These are women who are generally successful, but find a
        block in the road that often causes disclarity and a lack of progress. I also service women who are looking for a transformational pivot in a life that seems to be stagnant and not fulfilling.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-yellow">
      <p class="question">What is the difference between life coaching and therapy?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Life Coaching concentrates primarily on overcoming habits of the present self and future steps to take. We tap into the past slightly to gain an understanding of the limiting belief and its depth. We are very focused on discovering future
        aligned action. We also guide our clients to solutions and epiphanies using tge inquiry process. We dont tell our clients what they are feeling Therapy includes discovery of the future, but focuses a lot on processing and validating present
        and past self. Therapists take time to uncover past traumas and recover from those traumas first. Therapists take a more dominant role in identifying the problem and solution.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-pink">
      <p class="question">How do I know I need life coaching or therapy?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Generally speaking of you believe to be troubled by a trauma that is engraved in the past that has yet to be processed, I recommend you see a therapist. The intensity of the trauma, anxiety, or depression is what defines which care taker to
        seek. Life coaching aids those who are looking for personal growth, vision, and clarity. It helps optimize your life and defeat obstacles keeping you from attaining your best life.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-green">
      <p class="question">Does life coaching really work?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>It depends on how involved and true the client is to the emotional work taking place. If the effort of the life coach is more than that of the client, it will not be successful. However, if the client takes on the work wholeheartedly, it is
        a very effective method of cognitive transformation.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-yellow">
      <p class="question">Can I see a life coach while I see a therapist?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes.</p>

    <button class="accordion-pink">
      <p class="question">Why do I have to enroll in a package first?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Typically, the success of a client rides heavily on regular sessions and accountability in the beginning. If clients decide to attend sessions as they please, lost progress and lack of efficiency ensue.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-green">
      <p class="question">What are the life coaching packages?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">

    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>After assessing the situation, a payment plan may be suggested, but it is not open for all packages.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion-yellow">
      <p class="question">Do you recommend I enroll my child?</p>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Typically, the answer will be no. The best client is one who is independent of others. They are responsible for their time and money. This gives them more incentive to follow through. More importantly, they are doing it because they want to
        not because their parent wants this for them. However, in some cases, there are children who are driven and want this for themselves and are cognizant of the monetary investment or in place for them to exclusive it. If this were the case, the
        youngest age to be accepted as a client is 12 years old. </p>
